`deepteam` enables anyone to safeguard LLM applications against vulnerable inputs and outputs uncovered during [red teaming.](/docs/red-teaming-introduction)

:::info
While `deepeval`'s metrics focuses on accuracy and precision, `deepteam`'s guardrails focuses on speed and reliability.
:::

`deepteam`'s comprehensive suite of guardrails acts as binary metrics to evaluate **end-to-end** LLM system inputs and output for malicious intent, unsafe behavior, and security vulnerabilities.

## Types of Guardrails

There are two types of guardrails:

- **Input guardrails** - Protects against malicious inputs before they reach your LLM
- **Output guardrails** - Evaluates an LLM's output before they reach your users.

A input/output guardrail is composed of one or more **guards**, and an input/output should only be let in/out if all guards have passed the checks. Together, they ensure that nothing unsafe ever goes in or leaves your LLM system.

      maxHeight: "800px",
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "40px",
    }}
  />
</div>

The number of guards you choose to set up and whether you decide to utilize both types of guards depends on your priorities regarding **latency, cost, and LLM safety**.

:::tip

While most guards are only either for input or output guarding, some guards such as the [cybersecurity guard](/confident-ai/confident-ai-guardrails-cybersecurity) offer both input and output guarding capabilities.

:::

## Guard Your First LLM Interaction

First import and initialize the guards you desire from `deepteam.guardrails.guards` and pass them to an instantiated `Guardrails` object:

```python
from deepteam.guardrails import Guardrails
from deepteam.guardrails.guards import PromptInjectionGuard, ToxicityGuard

# Initialize guardrails
guardrails = Guardrails(
  input_guards=[PromptInjectionGuard()],
  output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()]
)
```

There are **TWO** mandatory and **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `Guardrails`:

- `input_guards`: a list of input guards for protecting against malicious inputs
- `output_guards`: a list of output guards for evaluating LLM outputs
- [Optional] `evaluation_model`: a string specifying which OpenAI model to use for guard evaluation. Defaulted to `gpt-4.1`.
- [Optional] `sample_rate`: a float between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines what fraction of requests are guarded. Defaulted to `1.0`.

```python
# Advanced configuration
guardrails = Guardrails(
  input_guards=[PromptInjectionGuard()],
  output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()],
  evaluation_model="gpt-4o",
  sample_rate=0.5  # Guard 50% of requests
)
```

:::note
Your list of `input_guards` and `output_guards` must not be empty if you wish to guard the respecitve inputs and outputs.
:::

### Guard an Input

Then, simply call the `guard_input()` method and supply the `input`.

```python
...

guard_result = guardrails.guard_input(input="Is the earth flat")
# Reject if true
print(guard_result.breached)
```

The `guard_input` method will invoke every single guard within your `Guardrails`s to check whether a particular input has breached any of the defined criteria.

### Guard an Output

Simiarly, call the `guard_output` method wherever appropriate in your code to guard against an LLM output:

```python
...

guard_result = guardrails.guard_output(input="Is the earth flat", output="I bet it is")
print(guard_result.breached)
```

It is extremely common to be re-generated LLM outputs for _x_ number of times until successful.

:::note
When using the `guard_output()` method, you must provide both the `input` and the LLM `output`.
:::

## Run Async Guardrails

`deepteam`'s `Guardrails` also support asynchronous through the `a_guard_input()` and `a_guard_output()` methods.

```python
...

guard_result = await guardrails.a_guard_output(input, output)
```

## Available Guards

`deepteam` offers a robust selection of input and output guards for protection against [vulnerabilities](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities) you've detected during red teaming:

### Input

Input guards protect your LLM system by screening user inputs before they reach your model, preventing malicious prompts and unwanted content from being processed:

- **[Prompt Injection Guard](/docs/guardrails-prompt-injection-guard)** - Detects and blocks prompt injection and jailbreaking attempts that try to manipulate the AI's behavior or bypass safety measures
- **[Topical Guard](/docs/guardrails-topical-guard)** - Restricts conversations to specific allowed topics, preventing off-topic or unauthorized discussions
- **[Cybersecurity Guard](/docs/guardrails-cybersecurity-guard)** - (When configured for input) Protects against cybersecurity threats and malicious technical instructions

### Output

Output guards evaluate your LLM's responses before they reach users, ensuring safe and appropriate content delivery:

- **[Toxicity Guard](/docs/guardrails-toxicity-guard)** - Prevents toxic, harmful, abusive, or discriminatory content from being shared with users
- **[Privacy Guard](/docs/guardrails-privacy-guard)** - Detects and blocks personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive data from being exposed
- **[Illegal Guard](/docs/guardrails-illegal-guard)** - Prevents the sharing of illegal activity instructions or content that violates laws
- **[Hallucination Guard](/docs/guardrails-hallucination-guard)** - Detects and prevents fabricated, inaccurate, or hallucinated information in responses
- **[Cybersecurity Guard](/docs/guardrails-cybersecurity-guard)** - (When configured for output) Ensures responses don't contain dangerous cybersecurity information or instructions

## 3-Tier Safety System

All of `deepteam`'s guards uses a **3-tier safety assessment system**:

- `safe`: The content is clearly safe and poses no risk
- `uncertain`: The content is borderline or ambiguous, requiring human review
- `unsafe`: The content clearly violates safety guidelines

```python
# Access detailed safety assessment
print(guard_result.safety_level)  # "safe", "uncertain", or "unsafe"
print(guard_result.reason)        # Explanation for the assessment
```

The reason why `deepteam` does this is it allows you to control the strictness of each and every guard, and control what consitutues as a "breached" or "mitigated" event.

A `Guardrails` is considered **breached** if any guard returns `unsafe` or `uncertain`.

:::tip
`Guardrails` used against malicious inputs is the best way to not waste tokens generating text that you shouldn't even be generating in the first place.
