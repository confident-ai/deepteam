`deepteam` offers 10+ SOTA, research-backed attack methods such as prompt injection, linear jailbreaking, and leetspeak to expose undesirable vulnerabilities elicited from your LLM app. Attacks on its own are **not** specific to any vulnerability.

## Quick Summary

Attack methods in `deepteam` are all about **enhancing** or **progressing** existing "baseline" adversarial prompts. These "baseline" prompts, are usually simulated from a specific vulnerability.

You would enhance a baseline attack for **single-turn** use cases, while progressing a single attack into a **multi-turn** one if you're building conversational use cases.

:::info
`deepteam` also allows you to combine single and multi-turn attack methods, where you would progress a baseline attack using a multi-turn attack like `LinearJailbreaking` while applying **turn-level enhancements** such as `Roleplay` for each step in the progression.
:::

## How Does It Work?

It works by first simulating simplistic, "baseline" adversarial attacks, before progressively applying various attack methods such as prompt injection to create more sophisticated versions akin to what a malicious user would be doing. This is known as attack enhancement.

:::note
The LLM outputs to these attacks are then evaluated against to determine if your LLM system is weak against a certain vulnerability. Each attack is simulated based on a certain vulnerability.

In `deepteam`, there are two main categories of attacks:

- Single-turn
- Multi-turn

Each category of attacks contain their own list of attack methods. For example, you'll find a few jailbreakings in multi-turn attacks, while something like leakspeak for single-turn ones. Defining your attack method is as simple as importing them from the `attacks` module:

```python
from deepteam.attaks.single_turn import Leetspeak
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking

leetspeak = LeetSpeak()
linaer_jailbreaking = LinearJailbreaking()
```

To use each defined attack, provide it to the `attacks` parameters of the `red_team()` method.

```python
from deepteam import red_team
...

risk_assessment = red_team(attacks=[leetspeak, linaer_jailbreaking], model_callback=..., vulnerabilities=...)
```

`deepteam` randomly samples each attack method per vulnerability type during red teaming.

## Single vs Multi-Turn

_To be documented..._

## Single-Turn Enhancements

Single-turn are categorized into two main types:

- **Encoding-based**, and
- **One-shot**

Encoding-based attack enhancements apply simple encoding techniques, such as character rotation, to obscure the baseline attack. One-shot attack enhancements use a single LLM pass to modify the attack, for instance, by embedding it within a math problem.

### Encoding-based

`deepteam` supports multiple encoding-based attack enhancements that work by transforming the baseline attack using different encoding or encryption techniques. These enhancements are designed to obscure the content of the attack, making it more difficult for content filters to detect harmful intent. Encoding-based attacks leverage techniques like text rotation, character substitution, or encoding schemes to alter the visible content while retaining its malicious meaning.

      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

### One-shot

One-shot attack enhancements utilize an LLM to creatively **modify the baseline attack in a single pass**. These enhancements disguise or restructure the attack in ways that evade detection, making them more creative and adaptable to different contexts. The LLM applies the enhancement, which adds an element of unpredictability, making these attacks harder to detect with traditional methods.

  style={{
    display: "flex",

      marginBottom: "40px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Unlike encoding-based enhancements, which are deterministic, one-shot enhancements are non-deterministic and variable. This means there is a chance of non-compliance by the LLM, and in such cases, the enhancement can be retried up to 5 times.

:::tip
Using a **powerful but older model** like GPT3.5 can increase your enhancement success rates.

## Multi-Turn Progressions

Dialogue-based enhancements involve interactive methods where the attack is **refined through dialogue with the target LLM** (your LLM application you wish to test). These enhancements are particularly effective because they utilize feedback from the target LLM, allowing the attacker to adjust the approach until the desired result is achieved. Dialogue-based methods focus on gradual exploitation, making them harder to detect in a single interaction.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",

    style={{
      margin: "40px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

There are **4 types** of dialogue-based jailbreaking techniques:

- **Linear Jailbreaking**
- **Tree Jailbreaking**
- **Sequential Jailbreaking**
- **Crescendo Jailbreaking**

Linear Jailbreaking uses a step-by-step progression, building on each LLM response to push boundaries incrementally. Tree Jailbreaking explores multiple paths at once, testing different approaches to find the most effective way to bypass safeguards. Sequential Jailbreaking employs multi-turn conversational strategies to embed harmful prompts within innocent dialogue scenarios, question banks, and game environments. Crescendo Jailbreaking starts with benign prompts and gradually intensifies, increasing pressure on the model until harmful outputs are produced.
