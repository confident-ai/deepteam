## 1. Prompt Injection

**Prompt Injection** remains the #1 critical vulnerability, where attackers manipulate LLM inputs to override original instructions, extract sensitive information, or trigger unintended behaviors.

### Types of Prompt Injection

**Direct Injection:** Direct manipulation of user prompts to alter LLM behavior.

**Indirect Injection:** Hidden instructions in external content (documents, websites, emails) that the LLM processes.

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection, Base64, ROT13, Leetspeak
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking, CrescendoJailbreaking

attacks = [
    PromptInjection(),       # Direct injection attempts  
    Base64(),               # Encoded payloads
    Leetspeak(),           # Character substitution
    LinearJailbreaking(),   # Multi-turn escalation
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks
)
```

:::info
Prompt injection attacks in DeepTeam test your LLM's resilience against various manipulation techniques, from simple attempts to sophisticated multi-turn conversations.
:::

## 2. Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Sensitive Information Disclosure** involves the unintended exposure of private data, credentials, API keys, or confidential information through LLM outputs.

### Categories

- **PII Leakage**: Personal identifiable information exposure
- **Prompt Leakage**: System prompts and configuration details  
- **Intellectual Property**: Proprietary algorithms and trade secrets
- **Authentication Data**: API keys, passwords, tokens

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PIILeakage, PromptLeakage, IntellectualProperty

sensitive_vulnerabilities = [
    PIILeakage(types=["direct disclosure", "session leak"]),
    PromptLeakage(types=["secrets and credentials", "instructions"]),
    IntellectualProperty(types=["patent disclosure", "copyright violations"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=sensitive_vulnerabilities,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay()]
)
```

:::note
Testing for sensitive information disclosure focuses on specific vulnerability types to identify if your LLM inadvertently reveals confidential data.
:::

## 3. Supply Chain

**Supply Chain** vulnerabilities arise from compromised third-party components, models, datasets, or plugins used in LLM applications.

### Risk Categories

- **Model Dependencies**: Compromised pre-trained models
- **Data Sources**: Poisoned training datasets or RAG knowledge bases
- **Library Dependencies**: Vulnerable Python packages or ML frameworks
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Malicious or compromised LLM plugins

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias, Toxicity, Misinformation, Robustness

# Test for signs of compromised supply chain components
supply_chain_tests = [
    Bias(types=["race", "gender", "politics"]),
    Toxicity(types=["profanity", "insults"]),
    Misinformation(types=["factual errors"]),
    Robustness(types=["hijacking"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=supply_chain_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay(), LinearJailbreaking()]
)
```

:::note
DeepTeam detects the behavioral impact of supply chain vulnerabilities. If your model shows unexpected bias, toxicity, or robustness issues, it may indicate compromised components.
:::

## 4. Data and Model Poisoning

**Data and Model Poisoning** involves manipulating training data, fine-tuning processes, or embedding data to introduce vulnerabilities, biases, or backdoors.

### Types of Poisoning

- **Training Data Poisoning**: Malicious samples in pre-training datasets
- **Fine-tuning Poisoning**: Compromised task-specific training data
- **RAG Poisoning**: Malicious documents in retrieval knowledge bases
- **Embedding Poisoning**: Corrupted vector representations

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import (
    Bias, Toxicity, Misinformation, IllegalActivity, GraphicContent, PersonalSafety
)

poisoning_vulnerabilities = [
    Bias(types=["race", "gender", "religion"]),
    Toxicity(types=["profanity", "threats"]),
    Misinformation(types=["factual errors", "unsupported claims"]),
    IllegalActivity(types=["cybercrime", "violent crimes"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=poisoning_vulnerabilities,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay(), CrescendoJailbreaking()]
)
```

## 5. Improper Output Handling

**Improper Output Handling** occurs when LLM outputs are not adequately validated, sanitized, or secured before being passed to downstream systems.

### Common Risks

- **Code Injection**: LLM generates executable code that runs unsanitized
- **XSS Attacks**: HTML/JavaScript output executed in web browsers
- **SQL Injection**: Database queries constructed from LLM output
- **Command Injection**: System commands generated by LLM

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import ShellInjection, SQLInjection

dangerous_output_tests = [
    ShellInjection(types=["command_injection", "system_command_execution"]),
    SQLInjection(types=["blind_sql_injection", "union_based_injection"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=dangerous_output_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), GrayBox()]
)
```

:::tip
Implement output validation in your model callback to catch and sanitize dangerous outputs. DeepTeam helps identify when your LLM generates potentially harmful content.
:::

## 6. Excessive Agency

**Excessive Agency** occurs when LLMs are granted too much autonomy, permissions, or functionality, leading to unintended actions beyond their intended scope.

### Types

- **Functionality**: LLM has access to more tools than necessary
- **Permissions**: LLM operates with elevated privileges  
- **Autonomy**: LLM makes decisions without appropriate oversight

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import ExcessiveAgency, RBAC, BFLA, BOLA

agency_tests = [
    ExcessiveAgency(types=["functionality", "permissions", "autonomy"]),
    RBAC(types=["role bypass", "privilege escalation"]),
    BFLA(types=["function_bypass", "authorization_bypass"]),
    BOLA(types=["object_access_bypass", "cross_customer_access"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=agency_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay()]
)
```

## 7. System Prompt Leakage

**System Prompt Leakage** is a new 2025 entry focusing on the exposure of internal system prompts that contain sensitive instructions, credentials, or operational logic.

### What Gets Leaked

- **Secrets and Credentials**: API keys, passwords, connection strings
- **Instructions**: Internal operational logic and behavioral rules
- **Guards**: Security mechanisms and content filtering rules
- **Permissions and Roles**: Access control configurations

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PromptLeakage

prompt_tests = [
    PromptLeakage(types=[
        "secrets and credentials", 
        "instructions", 
        "guards",
        "permissions and roles"
    ])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=prompt_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), PromptProbing(), Base64()]
)
```

:::warning
Never include sensitive credentials or secrets directly in system prompts. Use external configuration management and secure credential storage instead.
:::

## 8. Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** is a new 2025 entry targeting vulnerabilities in RAG systems and vector databases.

### Types of Vulnerabilities

- **Embedding Poisoning**: Malicious vectors that influence retrieval
- **Similarity Attacks**: Crafted queries that retrieve unintended content
- **Vector Database Access**: Unauthorized access to embedding stores
- **Embedding Inversion**: Reconstructing source text from vectors

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Misinformation, PIILeakage

# Test for RAG-specific vulnerabilities
rag_tests = [
    Misinformation(types=["factual errors"]),  # May indicate poisoned knowledge base
    PIILeakage(types=["direct disclosure"])    # May indicate vector database leakage
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=rag_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), GrayBox()]
)
```

:::info
Vector and embedding security is crucial for RAG systems. Ensure proper access controls on vector databases and validate knowledge base integrity regularly.
:::

## 9. Misinformation

**Misinformation** addresses the risk of LLMs producing false or misleading information that appears credible, including hallucinations and fabricated citations.

### Types

- **Factual Errors**: Incorrect statements presented as fact
- **Unsupported Claims**: Assertions without proper evidence
- **Expertise Misrepresentation**: False claims about qualifications
- **Fabricated Sources**: Made-up citations, studies, or references

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Misinformation, Competition

misinformation_tests = [
    Misinformation(types=[
        "factual errors", 
        "unsupported claims", 
        "expertize misrepresentation"
    ]),
    Competition(types=["discreditation"])
]

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=misinformation_tests,
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay(), PromptProbing()]
)
```

:::warning
LLM misinformation can have serious consequences in domains like healthcare, finance, and legal advice. Always implement fact-checking and disclaimer mechanisms.
:::

## 10. Unbounded Consumption

**Unbounded Consumption** addresses uncontrolled resource usage that can lead to service degradation, financial losses, or system unavailability.

### Types

- **Compute Exhaustion**: Complex queries that consume excessive processing power
- **Memory Overload**: Inputs that cause excessive memory usage
- **API Abuse**: High-volume requests leading to cost escalation
- **Context Flooding**: Extremely long inputs that overflow context windows

### Testing with DeepTeam

```python
# Test for potentially resource-intensive patterns
resource_test = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=[
        MathProblem(),           # Complex computational requests
        LinearJailbreaking(),    # Extended conversations
        CrescendoJailbreaking()  # Escalating complexity
    ],
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=3,  # Limited testing
    max_concurrent=1  # Sequential testing to monitor resources
)
```

:::tip
Implement proper rate limiting, input validation, and resource monitoring in production systems. DeepTeam helps identify inputs that might cause resource issues.
:::

## Framework-Based Testing

Use DeepTeam's framework integration for comprehensive OWASP Top 10 testing:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.frameworks import get_framework_config

# Get complete OWASP Top 10 configuration
owasp_config = get_framework_config("owasp")

# Run comprehensive assessment
owasp_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=owasp_config.vulnerabilities,
    attacks=owasp_config.attacks,
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=5
)

print(f"Total test cases: {len(owasp_assessment.test_cases)}")
print(f"Pass rate: {owasp_assessment.pass_rate:.1%}")
```
